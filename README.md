# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Level 1
Write a react app which lists baby names from the given file.

It should display boys' and girls' names differently - your choice*

The names should be displayed in alphabetical order, ascending.

Your project should be on GitHub and Netlify with correct names (see Hosting, above).

## Level 2
Add a search bar.

When someone types into it, your app should update the displayed list of baby names to only show matches.

Matches should be case-insensitive.

When the search bar is clear, all names should be shown.

## Level 3
Add "favourites".

When the user clicks a name from the main list, it should be moved to a "favourites" list, displayed separately. It should disappear from the main list!

When the user clicks a name from the favourites list, it should be moved back to the main list. It should disappear from the favourites list!

## Level 4
Add "name gender" filter buttons.

Add buttons that allow the user to only see boy or girl names (or all names).

The buttons should operate as "radio" buttons - exactly one should be active at any time.

The app should start by showing all names.

The app should make it clear which filter is in effect.

How it works with search:

If there is also a search term in effect, your app should apply any name gender filter to those search results.
